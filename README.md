# one-piece-defender
Source code of my game One Piece Defender

Made over the course of a week (as assignment for one out of five courses at the time)
Created by a team of three: I did all of the code, my teammates prepared sprites (Source: spriters resource) and designed the game.
Experience in C++ at the time of creation was six weeks. We were not allowed to use classes for the assignment, so it's all in one file.
